        <p>¹  After the treatment request has been submitted and the deposit has been paid, the doctor selected by the patient will check the treatment request and its medical justifiability. Remote treatment is not possible in all cases and requires recognized professional standards in accordance with Section 630a of the German Civil Code (BGB). The doctor selected by the patient during the treatment request decides exclusively on the implementation of a therapeutic measure with medicinal cannabis, taking into account all aspects in the questionnaire and the further course of treatment.</p>
        <p>² The fee for the treatment request of €14.99 is a deposit that you will receive back if a treatment request is not made by the doctor you have selected, but he or she has not yet carried out a medical consultation at that time (e.g. if you decide to cancel the treatment request without obligation). If you are eligible for telemedical treatment, the deposit you have paid will be offset against the fee of the same amount for the treatment request by the doctor. You will receive an invoice after the treatment by the doctor.</p>
